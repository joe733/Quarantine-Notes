# Contorlling
- Setting Standart | Measuring Perfomrance | Correction Devation

### Setting Standard
e.g. ISO, FSI, ISI etc.
- It is dertmined in the organization
### Measuring the performance
- The work done is measured against the kept standards
- e.g. exams measures the students preperations or the measuring the time to run a program
### Correction (after Comparison)
- To minimize the deviation from the standard

## Types of Contorlling
1. Control as a Feedback (Reactive Control)
- Aka. output control
- Feedback is taken is taking from the process.
- It is also commited which means no corrective action cannot be taken during the process but only after th process.
Steps:
	1. Desired Perfomance -> 2. Actual Performance -> 3. Measurement of Actual Performance -> 4. Comparison of Actual against standard -> 5. Identification of deviation -> 6. Analysis of causes -> 7. Corrective Actions are planned -> 8. Implementation

2. Feedforward Contolling (Preventive Control)
- Take preventive action before the problems occur
- Consider Human, Input, Financial etc.
- e.g. Considering the aspects of constuction even before begining it.

3. Concurrent Controlling (Progressive Control)
- Aka. Realtime control
- Concentrates on the present situation
- Even the while the work is progress the corrective work is carried on.

## Controlling Techniquies
1. Budget: A finiacial statement which declares the financial stand of the organaziation (an example of Feedback control)
2. Gantt Chart (non-budgetery term): It track the progress of activities that help to reach milestone in a project using a bar diagram. (x-axis: unit of time; y-axis: activities)

## PERT (Program Evaluation & Review Technique)
- It gives priority to the critical activities / path / elements
- It is an imput based forwared looking control method
	1. Optimistic Time (t_o)
	2. Most likely time (t_m)
	3. Pessimistic Time (t_p)

==> with these Expected time (t_e) is calculated.

- Does not analyse the cost

## Other Tehcniques
1. Statical Control
2. Break Even Analysis
3. Management Audit
4. Personal Observation
5. Standart Costing
